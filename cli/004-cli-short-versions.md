### Improve short versions of commands, bring consistency

Currently shorter versions of tctl commands lack in consistency, as an example here is a snippet from `--help`:
``` bash
$ tctl -h

...
- COMMANDS:
   namespace, n       ...
   workflow, wf       ...
   activity, act      ...
   taskqueue, tq      ...
   admin, adm         ...
   cluster, cl        ...
   dataconverter, dc  ...
...
```
As you can see, short versions of commands are randomly different in length.

Change the short versions of commands to a single character only. Remove some of the short versions especially for the commands that are expected to be used less.

New structure for `--help`:

``` bash
$ tctl -h

...
- COMMANDS:
   namespace, n       ...
   workflow, w        ...
   activity, a        ...
   taskqueue, t       ...
   admin              ...
   cluster,           ...
   dataconverter,     ...
...
```

Follow a similar principal for :
- sub-commands, ex. `workflow desc` -> `workflow d`. Remove lesser used shorts such as `workflow term` (for terminate sub-command)
- flags, ex. `--print_json` which has a short `--pjson` should be changed to `-j` (for `--json`).
